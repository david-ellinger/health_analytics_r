   Daily Death Increase and the relationship with Stay at Home orders
output: github_document
---

# Background and Significance
For my project, I am consuming the [API from The Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/api). The datasets provided allow for in depth analysis of the U.S national and state data relating to Covid-19. Covid-19 has rapidly been spreading over the course of the last year. Analyzing data may help us better prepare for the next pandemic, help develop a vaccine, drive better pandemic safety protocols in the future.


# Problem
Was there a decrease in daily deaths after a state gave stay at home orders? 

# Proposed Solution

My solution pulls down data for all states in the New England region of the united states. Based on the National Academy for State Health Policy, the original stay at home order dates are captured along with other information. Each state is different in their policies so it is not a one for one match, but does give a good regional idea.

# Demo

```{r}
install.packages("pacman",repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
pacman::p_load(httr, jsonlite, corrplot, ggplot2, dplyr, gridExtra, install = TRUE)

generate_state_chart <- function(state, stay_at_home_start, stay_at_home_end) {
  api <- paste("api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/",c(tolower(state)),"/daily.json", sep="")
  raw_state_data <- GET(api)
  raw_state_text <- content(raw_state_data, "text")
  raw_state_json <- fromJSON(raw_state_text)
  state_data <- as.data.frame(raw_state_json)
  
  stay_at_home_start_date = as.Date(stay_at_home_start, "%Y-%m-%d") 
  stay_at_home_end_date = as.Date(stay_at_home_end, "%Y-%m-%d") 
  
  
  start = stay_at_home_start_date - 30
  end = stay_at_home_end_date + 30
  
  rect <- data.frame(xmin=stay_at_home_start_date, xmax=stay_at_home_end_date, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf)
  
  p <- state_data %>%
    mutate(date = as.Date(as.character(date), "%Y%m%d")) %>%
    filter(state %in% c(state))  %>%
    filter(as.Date(date, "%Y%m%d") > start) %>%
    filter(as.Date(date, "%Y%m%d") <= end) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = deathIncrease)) + 
    geom_line() +
    xlab(paste(state, "stay at home orders (30 days before and after)")) + 
    ylab("# of Deaths/Day") +
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month",
                 date_labels = "%B")
  
  return(p + geom_rect(data=rect, aes(xmin=xmin, xmax=xmax, ymin=ymin, ymax=ymax),
                color="grey20",
                alpha=0.5,
                inherit.aes = FALSE))
}

massachusetts = generate_state_chart("MA", "2020-04-24", "2020-05-18")
vermont = generate_state_chart("VT", "2020-03-24", "2020-05-15")
new_hampshire = generate_state_chart("NH", "2020-03-27", "2020-06-15")
maine = generate_state_chart("ME", "2020-04-02", "2020-05-31")
rhode_island = generate_state_chart("RI", "2020-03-28", "2020-05-08")
connecticut = generate_state_chart("CT", "2020-03-23", "2020-05-20")


grid.arrange(massachusetts, vermont, new_hampshire, maine, rhode_island, connecticut, ncol=2)
```

# Improvements
There is a lot that can be improved here, as far as visibility and scope of data. Applying this to all states would be difficult due to each state having autonomous guidelines.
